# Combinational_logic_circuit_implementation_using_integrated_circuits
Aim of this lab is to learn how to construct combinational logic circuits using integrated circuits (such as 74HC163 four bit counter, 74HC32N 2 inp OR gates, 74HC08 2 inp AND gates) and other components (such as resistors, LEDâ€™s) on breadboard.
Combinational logic function described in lab 2 respritory is implemented using integrated circuits instead of fpga board. Design and results attached to the report document
